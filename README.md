# This is a repository for a long-term analysis of trophic position in palila (Loxioides bailleui). 

The palila is an endemic Hawaiian land bird that only resides on the upper slopes of one volcano on the island of Hawai`i. It is critically endangered and is actively declining in both its abundance and geographic range. 

This project aims to examine how dietary and environmental factors are contributing to this problem, and if there is any practical management advice that may result. Specifically, the analysis will document any changes in trophic level (TL) in palila from 1880-present, establish the TL of the commonest palila forage items, and to infer from the two any dietary shifts over time. In addition, we've examined environmental factors which might explain the TP changes. 

The project was initiated in 2018 and is a collaboration between the Monterey Bay Aquarium (Van Houtan, Gagne), the US Geological Survey (Banko, Peck), the Bishop Museum (Haggeman), and UC Davis (Yarnes). It is based on the Ocean Memory Lab model developed at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and the majority of the specimen preparation and analysis was done at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 

The original code was drafted by Tyler Gagne when he was at the Monterey Bay Aquarium (2017-2019) and later revised and expanded by Van Houtan (2022-2024) considering new methods, datasets, and visualizations.
